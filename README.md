# Startled-Markets
Startled-Markets starts with a simple representation of CBOE options data, specifically put and call options on the S&P 500 index. StratBox, a Python-based trading API for use with MarketWatch's virtual stock market games can use a number of strategies to buy and sell S&P ETFs and related securities based on this VIX-like indicator. It all culminates in a web application that shows both the CBOE data, as well as the position taken by StratBox.
